## Installation

### Pre-built binaries

We provide several options to access pre-built binaries for a variety of platforms. If you would like to manually download a pre-built binary, checkout [the latest release on GitHub](https://github.com/pka/owntrack-rs/releases/latest).

### Installer scripts

#### macOS and Linux:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/pka/owntrack-rs/releases/latest/download/owntrack-rs-installer.sh | sh
```

### Docker

There is a Docker image available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sourcepole/owntrack-rs).

Usage:
```
docker run -d --name owntrack-rs --rm -p 8083:8083 --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $PWD:/db -e DB_CONNECTION=sqlite://db/owntracks.sqlite sourcepole/owntrack-rs
```

### Docker Compose

There is a sample `docker-compose.yml` file that can be used to run owntrack-rs with a SQLite database and a Caddy reverse proxy.

Copy [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/pka/owntrack-rs/raw/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml) and [Caddyfile](https://github.com/pka/owntrack-rs/raw/refs/heads/main/Caddyfile)
into an empty directory.

Setup your DNS pointing to the public IP address of your server.

Create an `.env` file with the following content:
```
#HTTP_ADDRESS=owntracks.example.org
OTRS_USERNAME=owntracks
OTRS_PASSWORD='private'
# docker compose exec caddy caddy hash-password --plaintext 'private'
OTRS_PASSWORD_HASH='$2a$14$CkbCQwO7/duJ/kCObNwEPeiZlmgXrWZ0PXah1DlfkCF70.BIwzZVC'
OTRS_DEVICE_ID=mobile
OTRS_TID=me

#MQTT_URL=mqtts://owntracks.example.org:8883
#MQTT_USER=otrecorder
#MQTT_PASSWORD='mypassword'
```

Make it readable for the current user only:
```
chmod 600 .env
```

Start the containers:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

Using the default values, owntrack-rs will be available at `https://localhost` with login user `owntracks` and password `private`.

### Build From Source

For users who need to install owntrack-rs on platforms that we do not yet provide pre-built binaries for, you will need to build from source.
`owntrack-rs` is written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and uses [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html) to build. Once you've [installed the Rust toolchain (`rustup`)](https://rustup.rs/), run:

```sh
cargo install --path .
```

## Setup & run

Run with default configuration:

```
owntrack-rs
```

Configuration options are passed as environment variables or read from a `.env` configuration file.

Configuration options:
* `HTTP_LISTEN`: IP address and port to listen on. Default: `0.0.0.0:8083`

### MQTT

For getting location data via MQTT, an MQTT broker like Mosquitto is required.

Configuration options:
* `MQTT_URL`: MQTT broker URL. Example: `mqtts://owntracks.example:8883`
* `MQTT_USER`: MQTT user name.
* `MQTT_PASSWORD`: MQTT password.

### SQLite database

Configuration options:
* `DB_CONNECTION`: Database connection URL. Default: `sqlite://owntracks.sqlite`

### PostgreSQL database

Create database:
```
psql postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE owntracks"
```

Configuration options:
* `DB_CONNECTION`: libpq connection string or PostgreSQL URI. Example: `postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/owntracks`
